# Scoreboard Algorithm Simulator

Implementation of the scoreboard algorithm for subset of MIPS commands. 
After building the simulator you can run it using next command-

**Scoreboard.exe cfg.txt memin.txt memout.txt regout.txt traceinst.txt traceunit.txt**

* cfg.txt – configuration of the simulator units.

* memin.txt – input memory. (in hex)

* memout.txt - output memory. (in hex)

* regout.txt – registers values in single precision after simulation execution.

* traceinst.txt – instructions trace.

* traceunit.txt – chosen unit trace, the unit is declare in cfg.txt.

Examples are under Example/test1_raw/test2_waw/test3_war folders.
